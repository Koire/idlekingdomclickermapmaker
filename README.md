A map maker for Idle Kingdom Clicker in JS 

This app is made with Honeycomb Grid and Hyperapp for a very minimal state management system.
Maps are all drawn with svg elements.

just use npm run dev or npm run build to generate a package.

Todo:
- [ ] Change map sizes based on game maps
- [ ] Load/Save maps
- [ ] Load/Save paths
- [ ] Add a path selection tool
- [ ] Calculate cost for selected tiles (and time?)
- [ ] Estimate Prestige
